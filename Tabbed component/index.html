              Nature is the endless expanse of life forms, beauty, resources,
              peace and nourishment. Every bud that grows to a flower, every
              caterpillar that flies with the wings of a butterfly and every
              infant who faces the world as a human, owes its survival and
              sustenance to nature. In addition to providing resources for our
              daily needs of food, clothing and shelter, nature also contributes
              to different industries and manufacturing units. Paper, furniture,
              oil, gemstones, petrol, diesel, the fishing industry, electrical
              units, etc. all derive their basic components from nature.While it
              is necessary to keep up with industrialization, it is an urgent
              need now to restore stability in nature. People are trying to curb
              the level of pollution and stop the exhaustion of natural
              resources. However, more awareness and implementation is a must at
              the individual and community levels. We must always remember it is
              us who depend on nature for survival and not the other way round.

              other products are obtained indirectly from nature which includes
              timber, paper, medicinal herbs, fibers, cotton, silk and various
              kinds of food. To fulfill the demand for these products, human
              beings have now engaged in the slaughter of trees and the
              destruction of nature. Different industries also poison nature
              with harmful gases and chemicals in addition to using excessive
              natural resources.

              Great lengths of mountains, thriving ecosystems, the
              ever-spreading sky together with the lithosphere, hydrosphere and
              atmosphere create a saga called “Nature”. Rich both in terms of
              its scenic beauty and replenishing resources, nature accounts for
              supporting life in different shapes and forms on our planet. Every
              member of the living world obtains its life support from nature.
              Nature guides the cycling of air, water and life between the
              different constituents or spheres on Earth. The treasures in
              nature not only provide for our basic requirements of survival but
              also fuel the raw materials to support factories and industries on
              which the modern world primarily runs.
